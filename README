Implement D&C Sat algorithm for cnf formulas. 
CNF formulas given as file input per http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/satformat.ps
If a solution is found, output the assignment, otherwise answer no.

Current implementation is a bit memory intensive. 
Subproblems do not shrink, even though the problem space has been reduced.

For recommeded benchmarks of size 20 and 50 variables, this is effective.
For problems of 75 variables, a segfault occurs.

Satisfiable clauses are solved in around 1msec, and 
unsatisfiable 50 variable clauses are rejected in <100msec. This largely has to 
do with the small size of these problems. 

TODO:
(done) For version two, extend problem structure to include a fresh overlay,
indicating which clauses have been freshly allocated by introduce. Modify
release to only free pointers owned by this instance, and not shared with
a parent. This should reduce the memory size.

Secondly, remove satisfied clauses rather than marking them as
length 0 and copying them into each child (partly done, the_true_clause is now available). 
Optionally, remove variable instances which have been asserted. This involves extending the variable
type to include a number, since currently the assumption is that the variable
number is coupled to the array offset in each clause.
