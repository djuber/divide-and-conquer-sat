Implement D&C Sat algorithm for cnf formulas.

Current implementation is memory intensive. 
Subproblems do not shrink and no attempt to share structure
has been made. For larger benchmarks (250 variables, 1000 clauses)
this results in termination due to excessive memory allocation.

For recommeded benchmarks, this is effective.
Satisfiable clauses are solved in around 1msec, and 
unsatisfiable clauses are rejected in ~500msec. This largely has to 
do with the small size of the problems. Even so, megabytes of storage are heap allocated in both cases.

TODO:

For version two, extend problem structure to include a fresh overlay,
indicating which clauses have been freshly allocated by introduce. Modify
release to only free pointers owned by this instance, and not shared with
a parent. This should reduce the memory size.

Secondly, remove satisfied clauses rather than marking them as
length 0 and copying them into each child. Optionally, remove variable
instances which have been asserted. This involves extending the variable
type to include a number, since currently the assumption is that the variable
number is coupled to the array offset in each clause.
